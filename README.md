# My Homelab Repository

Welcome to my homelab repository! This project serves as a central hub for all the resources, configurations, and documentation related to my homelab setup. It's a personal journey into learning, experimenting, and improving my knowledge of networking, server management, virtualization, and automation.

## üåü Introduction

This homelab is a hands-on exploration of IT infrastructure, designed to help me learn and experiment with cutting-edge tools, best practices, and technologies. From building virtual environments to automating processes, my homelab is a playground for innovation.

> **Disclaimer**: This repository is part of an experimentation project. As such, some configurations, setups, or approaches documented here may not follow best practices, may contain errors, or may require improvement. Feedback is always welcome!

The primary goals of this project include:
- Deepening my understanding of systems administration, networking, and virtualization.
- Creating a scalable and efficient setup for personal and educational use.
- Experimenting with new software and tools.

     > The HP server was designed to house 3.5" drives and included the railing for it. Due to only having 2.5" drives, I "MacGyvered" a solution with packaging material I had laying around.

## üöÄ Future Ideas

Here are some exciting enhancements planned for my homelab:
1. Upgrade primary server hardware for better virtualization performance.
2. Add dedicated GPU to primary server to allow AV1 de/encoding
3. Implement a backup solution.
4. Experiment with edge computing and IoT integrations.
5. Explore cloud hybrid setups with AWS or Azure.
6. Test new firewalls and VPN setups.

## üìÅ Repository Contents
