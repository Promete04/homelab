# My Journey
Since as of today, 31/05/2025, I will be documenting here more subtle changes that won't change the readme file.

## ->31/05/2025
Some important changes have been made. Due to the power shortage that happened the 28/04/2025 in Spain, and me not being fully prepared, my setup suffered damages, and I lost one drive,
no data was lost so it only hurted my wallet. This event made me rethink how I run my homelab, and several changes were made:
  * Changed the OS of my primary server from Ubuntu to Proxmox, boosting my Containerization and VM capabilities.
  * Made a script that simulates a UPS so I am able to automatically turn off safely everything. It is located here: `docs/Scripts/UPS`
  * Turned on AC recovery on both of the servers BIOSes, so no manual interaction is needed.
